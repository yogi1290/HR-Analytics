Why Data Mining is required for this dataset ? 
This data is imbalanced and there are some imputations(missing values replaced with substitute values).I also want to extract some pattern and knowledge from the dataset.
This data comes under classification. When a new candidate comes into company, given the features we can classify whether the candidate is looking for the new job or not.
Hence, I want to do data mining on this dataset.
